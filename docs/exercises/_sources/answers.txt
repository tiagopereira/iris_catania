Answers for exercises for IRIS mini-workshop at Pune in October 2015.


2.1.1  What is the recommended IRIS data level for new users?
A: 3

2.1.2 What data level is distributed via the IRIS search webpage?
A: 4

2.1.3 Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A: 2

2.1.4 How many 64-step rasters were observed on the 12th of March 2014?
A: 2

2.1.5 Where there limb observations on the 1st of March 2014?
A: No.

2.1.6 With an OBS-ID=3800111235, what is the exposure time? How many steps has the raster?
A: The exposure time is 15 s, and the raster is a medium sparse 16-step raster.

2.1.7 Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A: 4.

2.1.8 When observing a very large sit and stare with a 10s cadence and exposing the full detectors, how long can you observe until the spacecraft memory fills up?
A: The spacecraft memory is 48 Gbits (6 Gb). With the full detector the FUV images take about 2.5 Mb, the NUV images 2.2 Mb and the slit-jaws about 1 Mb. So with 6 Gb you can store about 1078 steps. With a 10s cadence the longest exposure (in hours) is then 10780 x 10 s / 3600 s ~ 3 hours. This simple calculation assumes that no data is downloaded by the ground stations during the observations, which is not always true.


**2.1.9 When observing with the small line list, which cameras dominate the telemetry?**
A: 1. NUV + FUV spectra. FUV spectra take almost twice as much as the NUV spectra, and together they are larger than the slit-jaws (which are slightly larger in size than the FUV spectra).


2.1.10 Which of the following statements is FALSE?
A: 4.

2.1.11 What are level 3 data?
A: Level 3 data are level 2 rasters assembled in time into 4D data cubes (or 3D for the case of sit and stare observations).
